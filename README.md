Learning DSA from scratch 

# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms Journey

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my learnings, code solutions, and notes while studying Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).  
I'm following the **NPTEL DSA Course by Prof. Naveen Garg** and supplementing it with problem-solving on various platforms.
